My own personal website done in React (JS) with the styled components framework.

Learnings:
1. Next project will be done with a Vite React (TS) setup for reasons of speed and size as well as ease of use.
2. It will include PostCSS for additional CSS compatibility and possible use of additional PostCSS plugins.
