export const INTRODUCTION =
    <><p>With the world coming to a screeching halt in March of 2020, I took that opportunity and initiated the first steps towards what would later turn out to be one of the best decisions I have ever made. My inherent affinity towards solving complex problems with a logical approach is far better suited for working as a developer than my previous career in Political Science.</p>
      
      <p>My fondness for blending creative and analytical thinking also carries over into my personal interests, where I also find balance in physically challenging activities:</p></>;

      3. purposes of data processing and legal basis website visit in general
    </h4>
    <p>
      When you visit our website, we collect and store access data in log files
      (so-called log files or access logs) to ensure the permanent functionality
      and accessibility of the website. In this context, we process the

      from which you access our site (referrer URL) Operating system Name of the
      Internet service provider Product and version information of the browser
      used Volume of data transferred, loading time The legal basis for data
      processing is our legitimate interest pursuant to Art 6 (1) lit f GDPR.
      This lies in ensuring the functionality, security and accessibility of the
      website for all site visitors, if necessary in the collection, defense and
      assertion of legal claims. You have the right to object to this data
      processing (data subject right to object to data processing in the
      legitimate interest pursuant to Art 21 para 1 GDPR). In this case, we
      will only process your data if compelling reasons worthy of protection
      exist on our part for further processing. A direct conclusion about your
      identity is not possible on the basis of the information. The data will be
      automatically deleted after the aforementioned purposes have been
      achieved. We do not use cookies or corresponding technologies on our
      website. Therefore, there is no corresponding processing of your personal
      data (e.g. no data transfer to third parties for analysis and tracking
      purposes). Contact form: On our website, we provide a contact form for
      easy contact with us. To use this form, please provide us with the
      information provided so that we can process or respond to your request. We
      process your personal data on the basis of the legal grounds of legitimate
      interest Art 6 para 1 lit f GDPR (provision of low-threshold electronic
      contact or communication options) and, where applicable, contract
      performance Art 6 para 1 lit b GDPR (contract, pre-contractual
      relationship). The data or information provided via the contact form will
      be used by us exclusively for the purpose of responding to your inquiry or
      contacting you. Alternatively to the use of the contact form, it is
      possible to contact us via the provided e-mail address, phone call or
      postal letter. You have the right to object to data processing on the
      basis of legitimate interest (data subject right to object pursuant to Art
      21 para 1 GDPR). In this case, we will only process your data if there
      are compelling reasons on our part for further processing that are worthy
      of protection.

    <h4>4. automated decision making and profiling</h4>
    <p>We do not use profiling measures or automated decision-making.</p>

    <h4>5. data sharing and recipients</h4>
    <p>
      As a rule, we only pass on your data collected on the basis of the use of
      our website to the extent that this is absolutely necessary to fulfill the
      stated purposes (operation and maintenance of the website via external
      service providers, data transfer to e-mail providers in the handling of
      communication). However, we may also be obliged by law or by the
      authorities to pass on data to third parties (e.g. passing on data to law
      enforcement agencies). For all data transfers, we ensure that only the
      absolutely necessary information is transferred and we comply with the
      data protection requirements for data transfer (e.g. strict binding of
      instructions for order processors via Art 28 contracts, obligation to
      maintain secrecy and confidentiality, obligation to fully comply with a
      sufficient level of protection in the processing of personal data).
    </p>

    <h4>6. data storage period</h4>
    <p>
      Your data will only be stored for as long as is technically and
      organizationally necessary to achieve the stated purposes and to fulfill
      our legal obligations. We retain log file data for a period of 6 months.
      If necessary, we also retain your personal data on the legal basis of
      legitimate interest for certain periods. When determining the periods, we
      take care not to infringe your rights and freedoms. If the data retention
      is no longer necessary, we delete your data immediately.
    </p>

    <h4>7. data subject rights / your rights to protect your personal data</h4>
    <p>
      You have a number of rights with regard to your personal data processed by
      us. You can exercise all of these rights free of charge and informally (by
      e-mail, by telephone, by fax or by post), if necessary after proving your
      identity, using the contact details provided.

          any time. In this case, we will inform you in writing about the data
          we have stored about you, the purposes for which we use this data, the
          categories of recipients to whom we pass this data and how long we
          intend to continue storing it. We will comply with your request for
          information without delay, but within one month at the latest.

      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Right to deletion:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          You have the right to request the deletion of your data processed by
          us informally at any time. We will comply with this request if your
          data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was
          collected, if you revoke any existing consent, in the event of
          unlawful data processing or if deletion is necessary to fulfill a
          legal obligation.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Right to rectification:</strong>
        </p>

          of course correct it. An informal request addressed to us is
          sufficient for this purpose.

          <strong>Right to restriction of processing:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          If it is not possible to delete your data or you do not wish this to
          happen, but you do not consent to the use of the data beyond its
          storage, we have a duty to restrict the further processing of your
          personal data at your request.
        </p>

          <strong>Right to data portability:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          we will provide you with the data we have stored about you, which we
          have received on the basis of a contract or your consent, free of
          charge in a common file format upon your informal request. You may use
          this data for your own purposes and pass it on to future contractual
          partners. If you wish, and if it is technically feasible, we will also
          transfer your data directly to an addressee named by you. In this
          case, we will inform you after the transfer has taken place. We will
          comply with your request without delay, but within one month at the
          latest.

          <strong>Right to revoke consent given:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can revoke given consents to data processing at any time with
          effect for the future, in which case we will cease data processing.
          The lawfulness of the data processing carried out up to this point is
          not affected by a revocation of consent.

          <strong>Right to object:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          If we process your data based on our legitimate interest, you have the
          right to object to further processing of your data under the General
          Data Protection Regulation. If you exercise this, we will no longer
          process your data for the purpose to which you objected - unless there
          are legitimate grounds on our side for further processing that
          override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves
          the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims.

    <h4>8. right of appeal</h4>
    <p>
      The EU General Data Protection Regulation and the Austrian Data Protection
      Act guarantee you the above-mentioned rights in the area of data
      protection. If you believe that one of these rights has been violated by

      authority. The supervisory authority in Austria is the Austrian Data
      Protection Authority, Barichgasse 40-42, 1030 Vienna. Claims against us to
      which you are entitled on the basis of other legal grounds remain
      unaffected.
